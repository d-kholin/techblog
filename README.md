# Tech Ramblings

Welcome to my tech blog! This is the repository for my personal blog, which can be found [here](https://ramblings.thegriffiths.ca).

This blog is intended to help me further my learnings in Devops practices and tooling. 

I'm using the default Astro blog theme, as I'm not and don't intend to be a front end developer.
